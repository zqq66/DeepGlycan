## Workflow Runner

Use the helper script to execute the full pipeline (mgf preprocessing → Hyper-Spec clustering → peptide search → inference → FDR) with a single command:

```bash
bash run_workflow.sh \
  in_dir=/path/to/mgf_directory \
  out_dir=/path/to/output_directory 
```

Notes:
- The script reads defaults from `configs/config.yaml`; CLI overrides take precedence.
- `out_dir` defaults to `in_dir` if not provided. `working_dir` defaults to the same MGF/output directory.
- You can pass any Hydra override in the same form (e.g., `mgf_preprocess.ppm_tol=15.0`).
- Run `bash run_workflow.sh -h` for a brief help message.

Hyper-Spec clustering
- For large-scale analysis we use Hyper-Spec to cluster spectra and help locate peptides. Install Hyper-Spec from https://github.com/wh-xu/Hyper-Spec (clone or install from source).
- `run_workflow.sh` assumes `Hyper-Spec` is available (e.g., cloned alongside this repo or adjust the script to point to your install path).
